\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\arabic*.}]
  \item Pick a loop that is taxing your energy.
  \item Compress it until one sentence feels unavoidable.
  \item Delete the redundant narrative with a tangible ritual.
  \item Measure the energetic shift and log it.
  \item Share your story with the tags \#MLPexperiment, \#DeleteToHeal, and \#EntropyOfEmotion.
