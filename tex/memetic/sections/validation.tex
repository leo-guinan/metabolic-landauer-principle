\section{Validation Pathway}

\subsection{Phase 1: Anecdotal Replication}
Encourage widespread participation to collect rich qualitative reports. Identify repeating patterns and edge cases.

\subsection{Phase 2: Quantified Nodes}
Recruit a subset with wearables or home sensors to supply HRV, sleep, and glucose data aligned with deletion events.

\subsection{Phase 3: Meta-Analysis}
Aggregate $n=1$ logs into an open dataset. Compute correlations between confidence shifts, entropy proxies (writing length, language complexity), and energy metrics.

\subsection{Phase 4: Academic Bridge}
Publish sanitized datasets and invite laboratories to replicate under controlled conditions, linking the memetic archive to formal experiments outlined in the academic paper.
