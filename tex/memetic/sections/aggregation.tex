\section{Aggregation: From Anecdotes to Living Data}

\subsection{Distributed Logging}
Use a shared sheet, form, or no-code workflow to pool entries. Minimum fields: loop label, confidence shift, energy shift, optional biometrics, qualitative notes.

\subsection{Pattern Spotting}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Plot $\Delta$confidence vs. $\Delta$energy.
  \item Cluster narratives (insight, forgiveness, closure, clarity).
  \item Surface wearable correlations (sleep gain, HRV rebound).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Publishing Memetic Papers}
Summarize findings as narrative briefs: infographics, threads, short videos. Highlight unexpected patterns, exemplary logs, and open questions.

\subsection{Archivist Role}
Assign a curator to sanitize entries, remove identifiers, and prepare datasets that labs can later adopt for formal replication.
