\section{Safety, Consent, and Boundaries}

\subsection{Non-Therapy Disclaimer}
This protocol is reflective practice, not medical or psychological treatment. Participants move at their own pace, pause when distress rises, and seek professional support when needed.

\subsection{Informed Participation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Opt in voluntarily; no hidden enrollment.
  \item Share anonymized logs only with explicit consent.
  \item Allow participants to delete their data at any time.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Emotional Safety Tips}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Pair with a trusted peer for co-regulation.
  \item Use grounding techniques (breath, movement) after deletion.
  \item If a loop triggers traumatic material, stop and connect with qualified care.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Physical Safety}
Deletion rituals should be low-risk. Fire use demands ventilation, water, and supervision. Digital deletion must avoid removing documents required for legal or financial records.
