We propose a unified framework linking information theory, thermodynamics, and human physiology. Grounded in \landauer{}---which states that the erasure of one bit of information has an irreducible energy cost---we hypothesize that human learning and metabolism are coupled through the energetic cost of deleting uncertainty.

Learning is conceptualized as a two-step process: (i) compression of experience into efficient predictive models and (ii) erasure of obsolete representations once confidence is sufficient. Failure to perform the latter produces informational residue---``unresolved loops''---that manifest biologically as chronic energy storage, inflammation, and stress. We term this relationship the \MLP{}: the energy cost of deleting uncertainty is proportional to an organism's metabolic rate and confidence in its world model.

This framework predicts that emotional resolution, cognitive clarity, and physiological health are energetically and informationally linked. The paper outlines theoretical foundations, a mathematical model, and experimental pathways to validate the \MLP{} across cognitive, emotional, and metabolic domains.
