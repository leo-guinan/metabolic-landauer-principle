# Academic Verification Criteria (A-VTE Stop Condition)

A study is deemed externally verified at the first instant that BOTH of the following are true:

## 1) Evidence Threshold

At least one pre-specified primary outcome, analyzed exactly as in the preregistered plan, meets the threshold:

- Bayes Factor BF10 ≥ 10, OR
- Frequentist p ≤ 0.005 with the predeclared model,

AND a corresponding standardized effect size with 95% CI is reported.

## 2) External Acceptance

The manuscript is accepted by the registered-report venue at Stage 2 OR accepted by a peer-reviewed journal without altering the preregistered primary outcome or analysis plan.

## Timer

The A-VTE clock starts at the shared Hypothesis Lock (tag: `v1.0-lock`) and stops at the earliest timestamp fulfilling both conditions.
